# React Portfolio

## Description

A simple portfolio showcasing my skills as a web developer.

## Installation

An npm install and an npm run deve will allow you to view it in the browser.

## Usage

You can read about me on the homepage, contact me on the contact page, view some of my work on the portfolio page and download my resume under the resume page.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![screenshot](assets\images\Screenshot 2024-07-22 215353.png)
    ```
